Testing:

The following features are currently available for testing:

UI Setup
  Test Criteria:
  Each UI button serves clear and distinct purpose (ex: “Music” button turns music off, “Settings” button brings user to settings menu).
  Note: Settings button is the top right hamburger-style button.
  
 Graphic Design of UI
  Test Criteria:
  UI has well-designed palette, not grayscale or monochrome.
  UI evokes fun and playful attitude. Bright and colorful.
  
Graphic Design of Pet
  Test Criteria:
  When hungry, pet looks visibly upset. Hungry when user is not actively feeding candy or has been away from the app.
  When content, pet looks visibly happy. Pet is happy when user is tapping candy button and feeding it.
  
Pet Animation
Test Criteria:
  When hungry, pet moves slowly.
  When content, pet moves quickly.
  
Food Addition
Test Criteria:
  Tap central candy icon.
  Candy total increases by 1.
  Multiple taps continue to produce candy.
  
Extra Food Makers
Test Criteria:
  Buy candy maker in shop menu (shopping cart button).
  Candy maker amount appears on main screen.
  Candy total automatically increases by constant amount per second.
  
Incremental Algorithm
  Test Criteria:
  Less expensive food makers add small automatic addition (ex: 1 food item per second).
  More expensive makers add progressively more additions (ex: 5 food items per second).
  Incremental approach means makers are “tiered” (ex: Keep buying 1 per second makers until enough food items to buy next much better maker, making older maker redundant).
  
Message System
Test Criteria:
  Messages appear on main screen and fit with GUI design (Colored textbox)
  Messages fade in and out and only appear/disappear when the user is on the main screen to ensure visibility (Do not overlap other menus).
  
 Sound Effects
  Test Criteria:
  Tapping candy button plays a sound effect.
  
Music:
  Test Criteria:
  Music starts playing when game is open.
  Music is playful and relaxing.
  
Notifications
  Test Criteria:
  Game is minimized with Android home button.
